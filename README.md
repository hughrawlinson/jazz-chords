# Jazz Chords

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/hughrawlinson/jazz-chords.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

An attempt to play some generative Jazz chord progressions over midi from the browser.

I should really learn how Jazz chord progressions work.

This project should help me learn them. Also, it'll help me learn typescript.

I'm writing typings and helper functions to build MIDI messages so there'll be no manual messing with MIDI bytes in the music bit of the code.

Planning on using the fantastic [tonal] library for the music theory stuff.

## Usage

It's a `create-react-app` app, so `yarn` then `yarn start` should get you up and running.
